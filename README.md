### Advent of Code

https://adventofcode.com/

This repo contains slightly golfed, quickly written Rust solutions,
to compare against other people's rust solutions; I'm more interested
in *how* people decided *in the moment* to approach something, than
what an optimal, golfed solution would look like.

The primary effort that I will be putting in this year, if at all,
will be extending [jr](https://github.com/AshyIsMe/jr) to run other
people's solutions.
